## How to use AWS SQS as your Message Queue

This guide is for teams with applications or services deployed on, the Ministry of Justiceâ€™s Cloud Platform.

For this guide you will need access to Cloud Platform's Kubernetes cluser, to do this please follow [this guide](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/getting-started/kubectl-config.html).

### Set your AWS ENV Variables
Firstly you are going to need to show the details of your Service Pod, this can be done using:
```
kubectl -n laa-govuk-notify-orchestrator-dev describe pods | grep "AWS_"
```
Replace laa-govuk-notify-orchestrator-dev with the name of your Cloud Platform namespace.

You should see 5 Environment variables, copy these to and place then in a local `.env` file.

### Get your AWS Web Identity Token
Next we need to find the value of `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` and replicate this file locally, this can be done by getting into the kubernetes pod using
```
kubectl -n laa-govuk-notify-orchestrator-dev get pods

kubectl exec -it [The name of the pod given by the above command] -n laa-govuk-notify-orchestrator-dev sh
```
You have now opened the Bourne Shell inside the pod and all future commands you execute will be run inside the pod.

Read the file referenced by the `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` by running
```
cat $AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE
```
Copy the contents of the file exluding the final `/` and place it inside a file named `aws_token.conf`, do not share or commit the contents of this file.

Finally go to the `.env` file you created previously and replace the `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` entry with 
```
AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE='/notify_orchestrator/aws_token.conf'
```
This file will be copied to your docker instance if you have a linked volume, which is set up by default.

### Set your Celery Broker Url
As we want Celery to be using the SQS Protocol we need to append the following line to our `.env` file.
```
CELERY_BROKER_URL='sqs://'
```

### Set the Queue Name and URL
To find the SQS Queue URL you will need to login to AWS, you can find how to do this [here](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/getting-started/accessing-the-cloud-console.html).

Once you have logged in make sure your region is set to the region you got from your Kubernetes pod. Ours is 'London' (eu-west-2).

Click 'Simple Queueing Serivce' in the top-left, or search for it if it isn't there.

Find the queue you are looking for by searching for your queue name, in our case `laa-get-access-development-laa_govuk_notify_orchestrator_development_queue.fifo`

Click this and create two envrionment variables in your `.env` file:
```
QUEUE_NAME=[Queue Name from the AWS Console]
QUEUE_URL=[Queue URL from the AWS Console]
```

### Make sure RabbitMQ doesn't start
To ensure RabbitMQ doesn't start when we run `docker_compose` lets append the following line to our `.env` file
```
COMPOSE_PROFILES='SQS'
```
